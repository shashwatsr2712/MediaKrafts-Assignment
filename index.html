                <p>Let's face it. If you think writing is easy, you're doing it wrong. 
                    Content is not just about putting words on there as you did in seventh grade. It's about influencing action from the readers and it all starts with "WHY".</p>
                <p>Why you are selling a particular product, why your product does what others cannot, why have you come up with your product in the first place.
                    It's not a secret that we Kraft content that sells and the reason we are able to do that is because we start by focusing on the why and let that inspire the "how" and "what".</p>
                <p>Which is why we believe that together what we can accomplish is nothing short of astonishing.</p>

                        When you have a question, the first place you turn to is Google. Its the reason search began in the first place.
                        The first result that you will find most often than not, is an article with the very answer to the question you had in the first place. Somewhere someone decided that your question was the one worth providing an answer to and that is the reason they took the time and effort to do just that
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now what this does is instantly develop an ounce of trust in your mind for the company whose blog it is. How do they benefit from it?
                        Well, they start with talking about the query and end up by showcasing how best to solve it and most often that happens with a product that they are dealing with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why this works is because now you know what the solution to your problem is and you already have someone in mind who can do just that for you.
                        That shows that not only are words in a particular format simple indispensable, but they are also actually the most lethal weapon in your content marketing arsenal for you to promote and sell your product.

                    <p>
                        Trust, credibility and sales: if that is not worth paying for I don't know what is.
